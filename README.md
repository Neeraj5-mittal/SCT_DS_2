# 🚢 Titanic Dataset EDA | Survival Analysis

As part of my Data Science Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**, I explored the legendary Titanic dataset to uncover insights into passenger survival patterns using data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual storytelling.

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to:
- Clean and prepare the data
- Explore variable relationships
- Identify patterns that influenced passenger survival

---

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed

✅ Handled missing values in `Age` and `Embarked`  
✅ Dropped irrelevant features like `Cabin`, `Ticket`, and `PassengerId`  
✅ Created a new feature `FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1`  
✅ Visualized survival patterns using gender, age, class, and group size  
✅ Generated histograms, bar plots, and boxplots for trend analysis

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate than males
- **1st class passengers** were more likely to survive
- **Younger passengers (especially females)** had higher chances of survival
- **Traveling with family** increased the likelihood of survival
- **Passengers from Cherbourg (Embarked = 'C')** had better outcomes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- `Python`
- `Pandas`
- `NumPy`
- `Seaborn`
- `Matplotlib`
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📸 Sample Visualizations

*(Add sample images here if available)*  
- Survival Rate by Gender  
- Survival Distribution by Age  
- Class vs Survival  
- Family Size vs Survival

## 🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how powerful EDA can be in storytelling with data.  
By analyzing survival rates through multiple variables, we uncovered patterns that reflected real-world inequalities and human behavior during disaster scenarios.
